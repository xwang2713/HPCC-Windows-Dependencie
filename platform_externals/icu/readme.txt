1. http://site.icu-project.org/download/54#TOC-ICU4C-Download
2. Follow the instruction in readme.html to compile ICU with VS 9 2008 64bit for both Debug and Release.
   It is important to build Debug version since Boost-regex rely on it to detect ICU.
   
   In short: open the "<ICU>\source\allinone\allinone.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
